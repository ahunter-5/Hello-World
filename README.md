# Hello-World
Hello,  my name is Alex Hunter, I am a current third year honors student at The University of Iowa studying Accounting and Business Analytics/Information Systems. Upon graduation, I plan to sit for the CPA exam. For the Summer of 2024, I am interning at Principal Financial Group within their Retirement and Income Solutions business. In 2025, I will be transitioning to a role at the company within Internal Audit and Risk Consulting.
